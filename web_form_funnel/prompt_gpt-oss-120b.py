# 📉 KPI Diagnostics — Contact Sales Form Submissions Down WoW

**Category:** Business / Marketing Analysis  
**Task Type:** KPI Diagnostics  
**Evaluator Goal:** Assess how well the model can reason through a real-world GTM performance issue, generate structured hypotheses, and propose validation actions.

---

## 🧠 Scenario

You’re a senior growth or marketing operator at a B2B SaaS company.  
It’s Monday morning, and the dashboard shows that **“Contact Sales” form submissions on the website are down 25% week-over-week (WoW)**.

This is a classic GTM diagnostic problem — common across nearly every company.  
Your goal is to think like a pragmatic operator and diagnose what’s going on.

---

## 🔍 Prompt

> Contact Sales form submissions are down week-over-week by ~25%.  
> Tell me the breadth of possible reasons, stack rank the most likely, and list 2–3 concrete actions to validate each hypothesis.

---

## 🧱 Instructions for the Model

1. **Topline Understanding**
   - Restate the KPI and clarify assumptions.
   - Identify any missing context that would affect interpretation.

2. **Potential Causes (Breadth)**
   - List as many plausible causes as possible across internal and external reasons.

3. **Stack Rank by Likelihood**
   - Reorder hypotheses from *most* to *least* likely.
   - Explain the rationale behind the ranking.

4. **Validation Plan**
   - For each of the top 5 hypotheses, provide 2–3 *specific checks* you’d perform to confirm or rule it out.
   - Include examples like:
     - “Check CRM lead source mix WoW”
     - “Compare conversion rate by device type”
     - “Inspect tracking events for form submit ID mismatches”

5. **Next Steps**
   - Outline what you’d do in the next 24–48 hours to narrow the issue down.
