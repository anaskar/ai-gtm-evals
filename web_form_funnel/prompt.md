## 🧱 Instructions for the Model

1. **Topline Understanding**
   - Restate the KPI and clarify assumptions.
   - Identify any missing context that would affect interpretation.

2. **Potential Causes (Breadth)**
   - List as many plausible causes as possible across:
     - **External:** seasonality, traffic shifts, ad budget changes, etc.
     - **Internal:** site bugs, copy changes, UX issues, lead routing, etc.

3. **Stack Rank by Likelihood**
   - Reorder hypotheses from *most* to *least* likely.
   - Explain the rationale behind the ranking.

4. **Validation Plan**
   - For each of the top 5 hypotheses, provide 2–3 *specific checks* you’d perform to confirm or rule it out.
   - Include examples like:
     - “Check CRM lead source mix WoW”
     - “Compare conversion rate by device type”
     - “Inspect tracking events for form submit ID mismatches”

5. **Next Steps**
   - Outline what you’d do in the next 24–48 hours to narrow the issue down.
