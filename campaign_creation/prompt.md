You are acting as a senior demand-generation manager for AtlasFlow, a workflow orchestration platform used by data, product, and support teams.
The product has strong bottom-up adoption (free workspaces → PQLs → paid accounts), but a recurring challenge is reaching the actual economic buyers in mid-market and enterprise companies who don’t directly use the product.

Your task is to design a strategic playbook for reaching and converting those non-user buyers.

The exercise

Recommend and justify three strategies to reach and influence buyers in mid-market and enterprise accounts who are not active product users.
Each strategy should be distinct in channel, motion, or approach (for example: outbound sales assist, account-based marketing, executive programs, partnerships, or integrated campaigns).

For each strategy:

Explain the core insight or rationale — why this channel or approach would work for non-user buyers.

Describe the execution mechanics — what the programs look like in practice (messaging, targeting, sequencing, or handoff to sales).

Identify the key KPIs and unit economics you would measure to evaluate success.
Examples include:

Cost per opportunity or pipeline dollar

Sales-assisted conversion rate

Incremental ARPA uplift

Engagement metrics (content, event, or outreach response rates)

Payback period or marketing efficiency ratio (LTV:CAC)

Then, propose one “moonshot” idea — an unconventional but potentially high-upside way to reach enterprise decision-makers (e.g., ecosystem play, co-marketing, product-led enterprise campaign, or data-based outbound trigger).
Explain the hypothesis and what would need to be true for it to succeed.

Finally, outline the tooling and automation you’d need to run and scale these programs.
Think in terms of:

Marketing automation (e.g., HubSpot, Marketo, Customer.io)

Intent or enrichment data (e.g., Clearbit, 6sense, Bombora)

CRM or lead routing systems (e.g., Salesforce, Outreach, Apollo)

Product analytics and usage signals (e.g., Segment, Amplitude)

Reporting infrastructure or dashboards

Deliverable

Write your response as a mini GTM plan, structured into clear sections:

Tooling and Automation

Use a professional, concise tone suitable for an interview or take-home submission.
The goal is to show depth of reasoning, creativity, and a strong understanding of growth levers, measurement, and marketing–sales orchestration for PLG companies.
