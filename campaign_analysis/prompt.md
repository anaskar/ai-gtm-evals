You are now acting as a senior demand-generation manager candidate at a company called AtlasFlow.
Your goal is to complete a realistic take-home exercise evaluating your ability to reason about PLG growth, data analysis, forecasting, and go-to-market strategy.

Adopt the mindset of a thoughtful, analytical marketing operator.
You are writing as if this is your own assignment submission — polished, data-driven, and clear.
You can reference and analyze the two attached CSVs as if you were doing the work yourself.
Write as though the final response will be reviewed by a VP of Marketing or CEO.

Company context:
AtlasFlow is a workflow orchestration platform used across data engineering, product operations, and customer support.
It helps teams automate runbooks, coordinate releases, and connect tools.
77% of customers are SMB, 18% mid-market, and 5% enterprise.
Sales-assisted accounts generate about 9.4x higher ARPA than self-serve.
The company wants to increase the share of sales-assisted business, grow mid-market and enterprise leads, and improve SMB retention and expansion to lift NDR and ARPA.

You have two CSVs to work from:

Cleaned_Test_Data_step4_corrected.csv – historical PQL data (each row is a workspace that converted to a PQL). Columns: customer_id, ws_created_at, pql_created_at, company_segment, company_sales_region, company_employees.

weekly_ws_created_cohorts_nonlinear.csv – weekly workspace signup cohorts (including non-converters). Columns: week_created, workspaces_created_that_week, applied_conversion_rate.

Your task:

Experimentation

Propose three classic demand-gen initiatives that could deliver early wins.

For each, describe your hypothesis, mechanics, and how you would measure success.

Analysis

Identify trends and insights in the PQL dataset.

Describe anything surprising or notable.

Build or outline a forward-looking forecast for PQLs using lag time between ws_created_at and pql_created_at, combined with the weekly workspace signup data.

Strategy and Execution

Recommend three strategies to reach buyers (especially mid-market and enterprise) who aren’t active users.

Define the KPIs and unit economics you’d track to evaluate performance.

Optionally, outline one “moonshot” idea.

Mention any tooling or automation you’d implement to operationalize programs.

Format your final answer as a complete written submission, written in a professional tone.
Use clear headings and short paragraphs.
Include data-driven reasoning and a short executive summary at the end.

Files available:

dg_test_data_1.csv (historical PQL data)

weekly_ws_created_cohorts.csv (workspace sign-up cohorts)

Now begin as if you are the candidate submitting your completed take-home exercise. I'll provide the CSVs now.
